This application creates an index of the largest collection of cool internet resources called [awesome](https://awesome.com/sindresorhus/awesome). 
It exposes querying functionality via REST API.


## üíú Some tech used

- [flexsearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) - Next-Generation full text search library for Browser and Node.js
- [bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) - Premium Queue package for handling distributed jobs and messages in NodeJS
- [typeorm](https://typeorm.io/) - ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript

## üì¶Ô∏è Run with docker

1. **Clone this repository**

    Move to your desired directory and run the following git command.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/bartolomej/awesomesearch
    ```

2. **Download and install [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).**

3. **Create [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account for image storage**

4. **Generate [Github access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) (optional)**

5. **Configure environment variables**

    Create `.env` file in `./server` directory, containing all required environmental variables defined in `./server/.env.example` template.

6. **Build and run docker containers**

    Simply run `docker-compose up` to run all services required for the app to work (redis, mysql, web and worker processes).

7. **Start client applications**

    You can then finally start the app in development mode with the following commands:
     - website: `cd website && yarn start`
     - dashboard: `cd dashboard && yarn start`
    
## ‚öôÔ∏è Run manually

You can run this app on your local machine as well, but you will need to set up a few things first:

1. **Clone this repository**

    Move to your desired directory and run the following git command.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/bartolomej/awesomesearch
    ```
    
2. **Install and run Redis server**

    This is needed for job queue functionality. Install from [here](https://redis.io/).

3. **Create [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account for image storage**

4. **Generate [Github access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) (optional)**

5. **Setup environmental variables**

    Here we will define private credentials for our app to use. This follows [12 factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/config).
    Required environmental variables are listed in `.env.example` file.
    
6. **Install dependencies**

    In your project root run `sh install.sh` to install required dependencies.
    
7. **Start applications**

    You can then finally start the app in development mode with the following commands:
     - server: `cd server && yarn start:dev`
     - website: `cd website && yarn start`
     - dashboard: `cd dashboard && yarn start`
    

## üî® Testing

- **Unit & integration tests**

    These tests validate that isolated and connected modules of code work well. Run with `yarn run test`.

- **Performance tests**

    These test real life performance of our application by simulating what normal users would do.
    To run these you will need to install [artillery tool](https://artillery.io/) and then run `yarn run test:load:staging`.
