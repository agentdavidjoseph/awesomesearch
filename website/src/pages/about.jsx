          <h2>What is Awesome list ?</h2>
          <p>
            Ever found a super cool website that you wanted to save for later ?
            Well <BlankLink>Awesome list</BlankLink> is the biggest open source
            collection of awesome links / resources that other people
            (mostly developers) found on the internet. It is released
            under <BlankLink
            href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/license">Creative
            Commons Zero v1.0 Universal</BlankLink> license, which means anyone
            can use, modify and distribute it for free.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project now known under the name 'awesome' was originally
            started by Github user <BlankLink
            href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresorhus</BlankLink> back
            in 2014 and now has over 141000 Github stars.
            Main project acts as a index or collection of other curated lists
            that were started by other Github users. Today there are over 600
            lists listed on <BlankLink
            href="https://awesome.re">awesome.re</BlankLink> and each of those
            lists contains anywhere between a few ten to a few hundred links ðŸ¤¯.
          </p>
          <BlankLink href="https://awesome.re">
            <AwesomeScreenshot src={awesomeScreenshot}/>
          </BlankLink>
          <h2>So what is awesomesearch.in then ?</h2>
          <p>
            AwesomeSearch is a web crawler and a search engine for <BlankLink
            href="https://awesome.re">Awesome list</BlankLink>.
            This service parses and indexes the contents of all those hundreds
            of lists that are listed on <BlankLink
            href="https://awesome.re">awesome.re</BlankLink>, so that users
            don't spend a lot of time manually searching through the collection.
            Project was build to make awesome list easily searchable and
            discoverable with good UX in mind.
          </p>
          <span>There are also a few other alternatives:</span>
          <ul>
            <li><BlankLink href="https://awesome-indexed.mathew-davies.co.uk/">Awesome
              Indexed</BlankLink></li>
            <li><BlankLink
              href="https://awesomelists.top/">awesomelists.top</BlankLink></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>How does it work ?</h2>
          <p>
            AwesomeSearch fetches some information (aka. "<BlankLink
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</BlankLink>")
            from the <BlankLink href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest">Github
            API</BlankLink>. It then parses the main README.md file - this is
            where all the links are found.
            Our servers then retrieve and store some metadata about those links
            (website title, description,...) and perform a screenshot of the
            site for better previewing experience.
